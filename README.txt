Analyze eCommerce data and turn it into actionable insights. As accurate as in your CRM.

== Description ==

See what turns your visitors into customers and what are their behavioral patterns. Forget about boring graphs and useless reports. Act upon customer journeys details, not generalized website activity.

- Act upon customer journeys details, not generalized website activity;
- Feed profiles data back to Klavyio, Facebook and Google for better targeting;
- Introduce advanced metrics like: attention score, recency, frequency, life-time value.

==Optimize Every Touchpoint in the Customer Experience==

Verfacto connects anonymous traffic with individual users across all devices.

- Find the perfect time to interact with your visitors based on their profiles, visit intent, and browsing behavior;
- Give offers based on user’s intent and expectations;
- Introduce your own rules to define segments.

==Access customer profile in real-time==

Imagine the ability to separate returning customers from visitors. Or adapting your onsite marketing by customer’s interests. Real-time customer profiler does exactly that.

- Act upon customer journeys details, not generalized website activity;
- Feed profiles data back to Klavyio, Facebook and Google for better targeting;
- Introduce advanced metrics like: attention score, recency, frequency, life-time value.

==Analytics with focus on privacy==

Use tracking that doesn’t violate the privacy of your users. Do not worry about GDPR, CCPA, or PECR.

- Get rid of cookie banners;
- All collected data is yours and exportable only to you;
- We don't use cookies or collect any personal data.

==We know where users come from==

Last click/channel attribution is often misleading. Verfacto uses an acquisition map to show where the user is coming from and what is his preferred channel.

- Define customer’s most converting channel;
- Adapt communication to customer’s acquisition map.

==Behavior insights via interest profile==

Our tracking is not cookie based, so we can store longer customer history and give you deeper insights about your audience preferred communication and engagement history

- Effectiveness of “organic” vs “paid” marketing activities on individual level;
- Compare visit and purchase patterns;
- Know the stage of customer’s journey and enable it with other tools you have onboard.
